1.Use these in a database you dont care to screw up!!! Save your files.

2.You are going to need to run all the tables in the database so you can log into your server
and read what name show's after you put in the name ID code.

3.Execute these batch files, if they dont execute properly change your encoding settings to either
  (65001 (UTF-8) or (932   (ANSI/OEM - Japanese Shift-JIS).
 
3.Empty your spawnlist table.

4.You will add or change the name ID code in the NPC table to see what code number equals what text.
